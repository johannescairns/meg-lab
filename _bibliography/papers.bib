	abstract = {Biological communities are complex, dynamic systems that underpin ecosystem functionality, yet their long-term dynamics and predictability remain poorly understood. Understanding how Darwinian evolution shapes these systems through eco-evolutionary feedbacks is a central challenge in ecology and evolution. Experimental studies using simplified microbial assemblages have yielded important insights into the ecological principles governing community states. However, an important knowledge gap is how selection within member species drives changes of community state in multispecies systems. Here, we present a fouryear evolution experiment involving a 23-species synthetic bacterial community propagated in two environments: a control medium and the same medium supplemented with the antibiotic streptomycin. Through combined analyses of community composition and genome evolution, we quantified the temporal changes in species abundances and the evolutionary trajectories of individual community members. The extended duration of the experiment enabled the detection of adaptive mutations and community state shifts that occur only over long evolutionary timescales. We show that community dynamics are environment dependent and reproducible across replicates, and that evolution of streptomycin resistance in a previously streptomycin-sensitive species on its own can induce abrupt community state shifts. Our results provide a direct demonstration of eco-evolutionary feedbacks within a multi-species community, revealing how a single adaptive mutation can reorganize complex ecological networks.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Research Council of Finland, https://ror.org/05k73zm37, $\#$346126, $\#$330886, $\#$327741, $\#$346128, $\#$364234},

	abstract = {Recent studies have revealed bacterial genome-wide evolution to be complex and dynamic even in a constant environment. The evolution is characterized by the emergence of new clades competing or temporarily coexisting as each clade undergoes evolutionary change. Previous studies on predator-prey dynamics tracking simple ecological and phenotypic metrics have shown predation to fundamentally alter prey evolution, facilitating defense evolution followed by coevolution and frequency dependent selection between defended and undefended prey genotypes. Moreover, these dynamics can differ between prey species depending, for example, on mutation rate and the physiological and fitness effects of the mutations available. Here we sought to consolidate these fields by examining genome-wide evolution in five bacterial prey species separately subjected to long-term evolution under ciliate predation. For all species, we found mutational signals of prey adaptation, with genomic and phenotypic data demonstrating changes in composition between the experimental treatments. Mutational targets and dynamics also differed between prey species. Intriguingly, however, overall temporal molecular dynamics across the prey species were strikingly similar to those of bacteria evolving alone, with constant emergence, competition and quasi-stable coexistence of clades. This makes molecular evolution more interesting and less predictable than we might expect based on existing coevolutionary theories.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Research Council of Finland, 346126, 330886, 327741, 346128Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, BE 4135/12-1},
