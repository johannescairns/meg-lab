**PhD researcher**

**Inga-Katariina Aapalampi, MSc**

I am a doctoral researcher at the Department of Biology, University of Turku. I am interested in how different stressors affect bacterial communities. Also, I am particularly interested in studying the development of antibiotic resistance and eco-evolutionary dynamics in multispecies communities.
