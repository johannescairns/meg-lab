I am interested in the assembly, temporal dynamics, and resilience of multi-species microbial communities. In my current work, I use both experimental and computational approaches to investigate how complex communities react when exposed to environmental stressors, particularly resource scarcity and antimicrobial substances.</p> </body></html>
