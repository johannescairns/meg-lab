The Microbial Evolutionary Genetics (MEG) Lab develops predictive, quantitative understanding of how microbial populations and communities evolve, with a particular focus on antimicrobial resistance, community resilience, and infection dynamics. We investigate when resistance evolution and treatment outcomes are predictable, and when they depend critically on ecological interactions among coexisting microbes.

Our research integrates experimental evolution, synthetic and clinically inspired microbial communities, genetic engineering, genomics, and bioinformatics. By combining ecological realism with experimental control and data-driven modelling, we aim to generate evolution-aware principles that inform antimicrobial therapy and improve understanding of persistent and treatment-resistant infections.

The lab is led by Assistant Professor (DDLS Fellow) Johannes Cairns and operates between Lund University and the University of Turku, in close collaboration with interdisciplinary infection research and data-driven life science environments in Sweden and Finland.
