**Aava Rantakokko, BSc**

I am a master’s student in genetics at the University of Turku. I’m doing my master’s thesis on testing the transfer of DNA barcodes to different Gram-negative bacteria for lineage tracking. I am broadly interested in genetics, but particularly in molecular and microbial genetics.
