**Postdoc**

**Anna Bischofberger, PhD**

I am a post-doctoral researcher with an SNF Postdoc mobility fellowship, affiliated with the experimental evolution and microbial genetics groups at the University of Turku. I am interested in the assembly, temporal dynamics, and resilience of multi-species microbial communities. In my current work, I use both experimental and computational approaches to investigate how complex communities react when exposed to environmental stressors, particularly resource scarcity and antimicrobial substances.
