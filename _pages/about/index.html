We investigate when resistance evolution and treatment outcomes are predictable, and when they depend critically on ecological interactions among coexisting microbes.</p> <p>Our research integrates experimental evolution, synthetic and clinically inspired microbial communities, genetic engineering, genomics, and bioinformatics. By combining ecological realism with experimental control and data-driven modelling, we aim to generate evolution-aware principles that inform antimicrobial therapy and improve understanding of persistent and treatment-resistant infections.</p> <p>The lab is led by Assistant Professor (DDLS Fellow) Johannes Cairns and operates between Lund University and the University of Turku, in close collaboration with interdisciplinary infection research and data-driven life science environments in Sweden and Finland.</p> </body></html>
